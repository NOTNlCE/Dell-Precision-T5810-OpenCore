# Notes

This is a working config for a Dell Precision T5810. Please note that based on your GPU some modifications may be needed. This repository needs some modifications to be updated to macOS Monterey, which will come in a future update. We are utilizing the iMacPro SMBIOS, but MacPro7,1 would also be appropriate with the addition of the RestrictEvents.kext extension.
